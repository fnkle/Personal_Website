		<h2>Programming Using an Object-Orientated Language - Revision App</h2>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>
			For this module our main assignment was to code a revision app for use in a school; this was my
			first introduction to the Java programming language.
			I made use of various OOP principals such as inheritance, abstract classes and interfaces in an attempt to
			create a highly cohesive
			application with low coupling.
			I am unable to share the code due to university policy.
		</p>
		<h3>Marks and Feedback</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Overall Module Mark: 84%</li>
			<li>Programming Assignment Mark: </li>
			<li>Tidy up code by splitting often repeated groups into functions</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Date</h3>
		<p>Year 1 Semester 2</p>
